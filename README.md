# Localize

A tool to iterate through Xcode project to get all localized keys that match our format and use those to write `.strings` files incrementally.

## Usage

Put the executable file into the root of project and run it from there.

Might be good to note that, as of now, since we haven't supported SPM yet, don't forget to add `localize` to your `.gitignore`.
